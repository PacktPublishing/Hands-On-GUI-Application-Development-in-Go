*Build responsive, cross-platform, graphical applications with the Go programming language	*

## What is this book about?
Go is often compared to C++ for low level programming and implementations that include faster processing, like GUIs. In fact it has been acclaimed to be better than C++ in terms of its concurrency and ease of use.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* The benefits and complexities of building native graphical applications 
* How the Go language makes cross-platform application development realistic and efficient 
* How to build platform native GUI applications using andlabs UI 
* How to build graphical Windows applications using Walk 
* How to build cross-platform GUI applications using GXUI, Shiny, and Fyne 
* How to use Go wrappers for GTK and Qt for GUI application development 
* Consider application and user requirements to pick the right platform/toolkit strategy
